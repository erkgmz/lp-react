        <p><img src={headshot} alt="Erik Gomez headshot" /> I am passionate about learning, development and technology. I am a General Assembly alumni with a  GitHub history that goes back to 2014 where I first began coding by making static sites with HTML and CSS. I began working for <a href="https://bulletproof.com">Bulletproof 360</a> in 2014 and got on-the-job experience in content marketing, search engine optimization, and a little front-end development. Then I discovered a passion for coding, JavaScript in particular. I know that's a clich√® but I actually mean it and here's why:</p>

        <Byline text="I love to learn" />

        <p>Actually, learning is a life-long pursuit of mine and there is an abundance of opportunity to learn when working with JavaScript ;). In my pursuit, I've developed <a href="http://tim.blog/2016/10/06/the-art-and-science-of-learning-anything-faster/">meta-learning</a> and <a href="http://tim.blog/2013/05/20/accelerated-learning-techniques/">accelerated learning</a> techniques that I apply on a daily basis, and I am always looking for ways to improve.</p>

        <Byline text="General Assembly" />

        <p>I realized that in order to become the front-end developer I envisioned, I needed a greater challenge. In 2015, I did the unthinkable and quit my job and enrolled into <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">General Assembly's WDI</a> (Web Development Immersive). The experience was intense: 14 hours of coding, six days a week, for 12 weeks, and it has changed my life.</p>

        <p>Immediately after graduating, I was selected for an internship as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.razorfish.com/">Razorfish</a>. There, I worked on a team of engineers and designers and had the opportunity to flex my front-end skills on a website in production for a global automobile manufacturer.</p>

        <Byline text="What about now?" />

        <p>I am spending most of my time working on projects for clients and learning the ins and outs of React.js.</p>

        <p>If I'm not making websites or learning something new, I can usually be found hanging out with friends or doing something with my wife, Kailey, our daughter, Leah, or my dog, Tito. My health and fitness are important to me so I work out a few times a week and love to spend time outdoors, hiking, and biking.</p>

        <p>I also love to cook. I usually experiment with new recipes or make the one I am currently obsessed with. If I'm not cooking, I'm probably looking for a new restaurant to try, most likely a "mom and pop" with a great rating on Yelp.</p>
